I am Quark, son of Keldar, and I have come to answer the challenge of D'Ghor, son of whateverâ€¦
Go ahead, kill me.
That's why I'm here, isn't it, to be killed?
Well, here I am, so go ahead and do it.
You all want me to pick up that sword and try to fight him, don't you?
But I don't have a chance and you know it.
You only want me to put up a fight so your precious honour will be satisfied.
Well, I'm not going to make it so easy for you.
Having me fight D'Ghor is nothing more than an execution, so, if that's what you want, that's what you'll get.
An execution.
No honour, no glory.
And when you tell your children and your grandchildren the glorious story of how you rose to power and took Grilka's House from her, I hope you remember to tell them how you heroically killed an unarmed Ferengi half your size.
