At 0800 hours, station time, the Romulan Empire formally declared war against the Dominion.
They have already struck fifteen bases along the Cardassian border.
So, this is a huge victory for the good guys.
This may even be the turning point of the entire war.
There's even a 'Welcome to the Fight' party tonight in the wardroom.
So I lied, I cheated, I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men.
I am an accessory to murder. But most damning thing of all, I think I can live with it.
And if I had to do it all over again, I would. Garak was right about one thing.
A guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant, so I will learn to live with it.
Because I can live with it. I can live with it.
Computer, erase that entire personal log.
